# Unwritten
*Unwritten* is an action roguelike game I am currently developing with a few of my friends in the game engine Godot. As of writing this the game is currently in a pre-alpha state, so the assets, mechanics, and general feel of the game are nowhere near their final state, but as time goes on I hope to flesh out the game and, fingers crossed, release it to the public.

## Installation
If you'd like to run this software, you'll first need to download the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) Engine (Version 4.2.2 or greater), and then import the files into a new Godot project. Once more stable builds of the game are available I will begin providing executables to make this process easier, but given how early I am into development at the moment I felt that it didn't make sense to package what is essentially 5 rooms with a single training dummy inside them. Apologies for the inconvenience.

## Contribution
Given that this is mainly a passion project I am not currently looking for assistance, but if you see this project and decide you'd really like to write some code for it I promise to at least look over any PRs submitted, and I will be sure to credit any work done that makes it into any official releases, both in the code docs and eventually in the game's credits.
